        "Colab notebooks allow you to combine **executable code**, **text**, and **code output** (such as images) in a single document. To save any work you do in a Colab notebook, it needs to be stored in your Google Drive account. You can then easily share your Colab notebooks with co-workers or friends, allowing them to comment on your notebooks or even edit them. To learn more, see [Overview of Colab](/notebooks/basic_features_overview.ipynb). \n",
        "\n",
        "To save a Colab notebook to your drive, you can use the File menu above and select ```Save a copy in Drive```. Notebooks will automatically be saved in a \"Colab Notebooks\" folder in your Google Drive. You can reorganize from there if you like. To re-open a notebook to view your work and/or continue working, open it directly from your Google Drive (If necessary: ```Open With``` -> ```connected apps``` -> ```Google Colaboratory```) \n",
        "\n",
        "Colab notebooks are Jupyter notebooks that are hosted by Colab. To learn more about the Jupyter project, see [jupyter.org](https://www.jupyter.org). They can run on Google's 'Research Collaboratory' platform (as you are doing now) so that you do not need to download any programs locally. However, working with these notebooks on Colab does require an internet connection. \n",
        "\n",
        "### Menu Options & Shortcuts\n",
        "There are also a large number of useful keyboard shortcuts. Click on the 'Tools' menu, and then 'Keyboard Shortcuts' to see a list.\n",
        "\n",
        "### \"Running\" Code\n",
        "In order for the text (code) written in these notebooks to **do** anything, the text needs to be **run**. Running code means *executing* it. The python <b>'kernel'</b> is the thing that executes your code. It is what connects the notebook (as you see it) with the DataHub computers at Google that run/execute code.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Types of Cells\n",
        "Colab Notebooks have two types of cells, a <b>Markdown</b> (like this one) and <b>Code</b>. You won't need to *run* the Markdown cells, just read through them. However, when we get to a code cell, you need to tell the kernel to run the lines of code that it contains. Then, the Python kernel will run whatever it recognizes as code within the cell.\n",
        "\n",
        "*How do you recognize a code cell?* Each code cell has a ```play button``` at the top left corner (a circle with a right-pointing triangle in it).\n",
        "When you click on a code cell, it will be popped out (shadowed) and you will then be in *command mode* for that cell. You can then press the play button to execute that code cell (and run the code it contains). Alternatively, you can hit ```Control + Enter``` on your keyboard.\n",
        "\n",
        "*Throughout the notebook, you will see instructions* starting with  **```TASK:```**. Often, the task includes running the code cell. Sometimes, the task will also includes making selection from a list or typing information into the code cell.  \n",
        "\n",
        "Most of the code in these notebooks have been hidden for clarity so that you can focus on the data exploration and visualization tasks and save most of the \"computer coding\" learning for another time. You can ignore anywhere that it says ```Show Code```. If you accidentally get \"inside\" one of these code cells, simply double-click to the right where you see either black space normal-looking text.  \n",
        "\n",
        "If you accidentally get \"inside of\" a Markdown cell, simply double click the version on the right-hand side of the cell to get back to normal-looking formatting. "
